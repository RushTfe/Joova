# Joova
Hoover Database with Java
An Easy to use database for Hoover Sellers, created with Java and SQLite.

## Getting started
To use this project you can choose to download between two options: 
* JoovaFull.exe: This contains the JDK built in, so you dont have to worry about installing it on your computer, but it will have a bigger size.
* Joova.exe: Program itself, you need to instal JDK10 on your computer in order to run it (just in case you didn't have it yet).

Those archives are not ready yet as the application is not fully developed. Wait for the releases!

### Prerequisites
* A computer with Windows to install it (Other OS's are not supported yet, but maybe linux will be later)
* JDK10 if you decide to install Joova.exe

Furthermore, if you want to edit this code, youll need IntelliJ to open it as a project, and run the JoovaAPP.java class in order to test it.
Eclipse is not supported, so you'll need to look for a different way to open it there.

### Installing source code with IntelliJ
In order to run this project on your IDE, you also need some other dependencies created by myself. I will add them later when theyre totally ready. Those are mostly Views for different parts of the app. 

Once you have them installed, you need to open them, go to the console and type "mvn clean install" on each module, so your main project can get them from your .m2 folder.

## Built with
